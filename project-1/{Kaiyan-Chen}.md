1. Discussed the best approach about how to design the xml file, and convert the last 7 items of json into xml
    - add stocks elements and accounts elements for each user
2. Created xsd for created xml file
3. Created xslt to display data in the table format
    - demonstrated all users by `<ol>`
    - split each user into "User Information", "Stocks Information" and "Accounts Information" to show related data
    - set width and color for each table header
